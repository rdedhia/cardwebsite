			<p><div class = "sec_heading">About Us</div></p>
			<p>The CardNotes is the final product of an Entrepreneurial Initiative class at Olin College in Needham, Massachusetts. Our idea stemmed from frustrations with losing business cards and with the process of connecting at networking events in general. One major issue that we identified was that many successful people try to take notes on the conversations that theyâ€™ve had with potential employers, employees, or partners. However, it is easy to lose track of which card belongs to which notes, to misplace either the card or notes, or to simply not have any place to write things down. Our idea evolved from an improved business card to a notebook that would help correct these issues. A CardNotes can help professionals stay organized and make strong networking connections.</p></div>
